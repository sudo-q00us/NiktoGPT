# NiktoGPT
NiktoGPT is a powerful automation tool that combines the web vulnerability scanner Nikto with a GPT-based AI (via OpenRouter). It enhances Nikto's raw scan results by analyzing and categorizing the findings using large language models (LLMs), then generates a clear, human-readable HTML report. Optionally, it sends the report via email.
