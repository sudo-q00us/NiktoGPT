# NiktoGPT

**NiktoGPT** is a Python automation tool that enhances the classic Nikto web vulnerability scanner by integrating AI analysis via the OpenRouter API (DeepSeek Chat v3.1). It runs Nikto, extracts relevant findings, analyzes them using GPT, generates a detailed HTML report, and can send the report by email.

---

## üîç Features

- Automatically launch Nikto scans
- Parse and filter the .log file intelligently
- Analyze findings using the GPT model `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free`
- Generate clean and structured HTML reports
- Optionally send reports via email (SMTP)

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Nikto installed on the system
- An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API key
- Internet connection (for AI analysis)
- SMTP access (optional, for email sending)

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/niktoGPT.git
   cd niktoGPT

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Make sure nikto is installed:
   ```bash
   which nikto
   
4. If not installed, you can get it via:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nikto

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Open the script run_nikto.py and edit these variables near the top:
   ```python
   TARGET = "https://example.com/"
   REPORT_DIR = "/path/to/save/reports/"
   NIKTO_BIN = "/usr/bin/nikto"
   ```

Set your OpenRouter API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key"
   ```
Edit SMTP settings in the script:
   ```python
   SMTP_CONFIG = {
    "server": "smtp.example.com",
    "port": 25,
    "use_ssl": False,
    "starttls": False,
    "username": None,
    "password": None,
    "from_addr": "nikto-reports@example.com",
    "to_addr": "admin@example.com",
}
```
## üöÄ Usage

Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python3 run_nikto.py
   ```
This will:

   1. Launch a Nikto scan

   2. Parse the generated .log file

   3. Send each finding to the AI for analysis

   4. Create a styled HTML report

   5. Send the report by email (if configured)

## üì® Email Setup (Optional)

Make sure the SMTP config is valid. If your SMTP requires auth, provide username and password in the script.

If no authentication is required (internal SMTP server), leave those as None.

## üìÅ Output

Raw Nikto log: ```nikto_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log```

AI-enhanced report: ```nikto_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_ia_report.html```

Original Nikto report (HTML or TXT fallback)

All saved under the ```REPORT_DIR``` path.

## üß™ Example Run
   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-your-apikey"
   python3 run_nikto.py
   ```
## üí° Notes

This script does not use a ```.env``` file. API keys must be passed via environment variables manually.

The AI response format is strictly JSON ‚Äî ensure the model remains compatible.

The script will fallback to sending the raw log if no relevant findings are detected.

## üõ°Ô∏è Disclaimer

This tool is intended for authorized testing only. Do not scan targets without permission.

## üõ† Troubleshooting

Nikto not found? Edit ```NIKTO_BIN``` in the script.

No results? Try a less filtered target or disable strict log filtering.

API errors? Check your internet and ```OPENROUTER_API_KEY```.

Email not sending? Try another SMTP server or test ```with use_ssl = True```.
